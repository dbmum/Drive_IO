# Drive_IO

This program impelemts a genetic algorithm to train a car to drive around a simulated track. Currently this code is still a work in progress. I am still working to create a better fitness function, optimize hyperparameters, and create a good way to view all of the simulated cars in pygame to see the results.

### To run the training

run the main.py file to train through the generations.

### Results

Currently the best results are in the best_car_results.txt file, with all of the respective models saved in the best models folder.
